# World Populations SQL Practice
Overview This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals
You’ll work with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. You’ll write queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this project, you should have completed the Learn SQL Manipulation and Learn SQL Queries lessons.

## Project Requirements
In this project, you’ll answer questions using a database of world population by country.

The schema of the database is:

Column	Type	Notes country	STRING population	NUMBER	(in millions) year	NUMBER Refer to this schema as you write queries to the database.

When you finish this project, you should be able to answer each the questions that follow using a single SQL query.

The first query has already been written for you to answer the following question:

What years are covered by the dataset? (you can manually count the number of years returned).

Continue adding your queries below the first one as you proceed.

What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?

What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?

What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?

How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?

What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?

Note: it’s okay to figure out the difference by hand after pulling the correct data.
